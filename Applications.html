        <li>AI in Navigation
Based on research from MIT, GPS technology can provide users with accurate, timely, and detailed information to improve safety. The technology uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Network and Graph Neural Network, which makes lives easier for users by automatically detecting the number of lanes and road types behind obstructions on the roads. AI is heavily used by Uber and many logistics companies to improve operational efficiency, analyze road traffic, and optimize routes.

        <li> AI in Robotics
Robotics is another field where artificial intelligence applications are commonly used. Robots powered by AI use real-time updates to sense obstacles in its path and pre-plan its journey instantly. 

It can be used for -
			<ul>
				<li>Carrying goods in hospitals, factories, and warehouses
                </li>
				<li>Cleaning offices and large equipment</li>
				<li>Inventory management</li>
              </ul>
        </li>
        <li>AI in Human Resource
Did you know that companies use intelligent software to ease the hiring process?

Artificial Intelligence helps with blind hiring. Using machine learning software, you can examine applications based on specific parameters. AI drive systems can scan job candidates' profiles, and resumes to provide recruiters an understanding of the talent pool they must choose from.

        <li>AI in Healthcare
Artificial Intelligence finds diverse applications in the healthcare sector. AI is used in healthcare to build sophisticated machines that can detect diseases and identify cancer cells. AI can help analyze chronic conditions with lab and other medical data to ensure early diagnosis. AI uses the combination of historical data and medical intelligence for the discovery of new drugs.
        </li>
        <li>AI in Gaming
Another sector where Artificial Intelligence applications have found prominence is the gaming sector. AI can be used to create smart, human-like NPCs to interact with the players.

It can also be used to predict human behavior using which game design and testing can be improved. The Alien Isolation games released in 2014 uses AI to stalk the player throughout the game. The game uses two Artificial Intelligence systems - ‘Director AI’ that frequently knows your location and the ‘Alien AI,’ driven by sensors and behaviors that continuously hunt the player.

AI can help with content marketing in a way that matches the brand's style and voice. It can be used to handle routine tasks like performance, campaign reports, and much more.  
Chatbots powered by AI, Natural Language Processing, Natural Language Generation, and Natural Language Understanding can analyze the user's language and respond in the ways humans do. 
AI can provide users with real-time personalizations based on their behavior and can be used to edit and optimize marketing campaigns to fit a local market's needs.
